# Pokedex - my first ever project in JS

Live site available [here](https://ad-szwed.github.io/pokedex/)

This app was created to pass the JavaScript portion of CareerFoundry web dev bootcamp.

API used is [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co)

First created with vanilla JS, then changed to mostly jquery and bootstrap.

As per the course requirements, it was supposed to be a bunch of buttons, each with a modal 
opened upon clicking it, giving you pokemon pic and it's height.

When I saw how it looks like i thought to myself:

And that's why it looks so cool!
